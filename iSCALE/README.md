# Scaling up spatial transcriptomics for large-sized tissues: Uncovering cellular-level tissue architecture beyond conventional platforms 

This software package implements iSCALE
(Inferring Spatially resolved Cellular Architectures for Large-sized tissue Environments),
an innovative framework designed to predict gene expression for large-sized tissues with near single-cell resolution. 


## getting starting
# download checkpoints available at: https://upenn.box.com/s/kmtmsa3lv8u92wuaw23uui40mgqiyxrc
# add checkpoints to the folder "checkpoints" in the iSCALE repository
run_iSCALE.sh 


## additional information about data input structure and parameters will be provided on GitHub.
