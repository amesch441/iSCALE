# iSCALE
## Scaling up spatial transcriptomics for large-sized tisses: uncovering cellular-level tissue architecture beyond conventional platforms with iSCALE

This software package implements iSCALE
(Inferring Spatially resolved Cellular Architectures for Large-sized tissue Environments),
A novel framework designed to integrate multiple daughter captures and utilize H&E information from large tissue samples, enabling the prediction of gene expression in large-sized tissues with near single-cell resolution.


# Get Started

To run the demo, use the file run_iSCALE.sh with directory prefix="Data/demo/gastricTumor/"  

```
sbatch run_iSCALE.sh 
```

Using GPUs is highly recommended.

### Additional information about data input structure and parameters will be provided soon
